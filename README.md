# Gender-pay-gap-in-Switzerland-across-Industries-and-Regions

This project delves into the persistent issue of the gender pay gap in Switzerland, focusing on disparities across various industries and regions over the period 2012 to 2020. By leveraging data visualization and statistical analysis, the project aims to uncover trends, regional patterns, and industry-specific challenges related to gender-based wage inequality.

## Description

The gender pay gap refers to the difference in average earnings between men and women. Despite progress, this gap persists in many societies. Studying the gender pay gap is crucial for understanding and addressing gender inequality. It helps identify factors contributing to the gap, such as occupational segregation, discrimination, and unequal caregiving responsibilities. Research in this area informs policy decisions, promotes fair employment practices, and ultimately strives for a more equitable society where everyone has equal opportunities regardless of gender. This project helps us dive deeper into the gender pay gap data from the Federal Statistical Office of Switzerland primarliy from 2012 to 2020.

## Data

This project is set up to analyze Switzerland's gender pay gap across various industries and regions, using data from 2012 to 2020. The analysis leverages datasets from reliable sources, with a focus on wages for men and women across different sectors and cantons. For those looking to replicate this analysis for a different country, similar data would need to be sourced from national labor statistics agencies or equivalent organizations. In this example, we use data from Switzerland, incorporating both regional and industry-specific details to provide a comprehensive view of pay disparities over time.
