\section{Introduction}
The gender pay gap remains to be a significant and persistent issue in contemporary labor markets, representing disparities in earnings between men and women. While progress toward gender equality has been achieved over the years, the wage gap remains evident between men and women in Switzerland. These disparities are not only reflective of broader systemic inequalities but also have implications for social equity and economic efficiency. Understanding the scale of the gender pay gap is critical for policymakers and as well as employers. 
This paper focuses on quantifying the gender pay gap across gross regions in Switzerland and industries. By providing a comparative analysis of these disparities, the research seeks to identify patterns and trends that reveal where wage gaps are most pronounced. By examining these variations, the study aims to offer a clearer picture of where wage disparities are most pronounced and how they differ based on geographic and sectoral factors. 
Rather than investigating the underlying causes of the gender pay gap, this research paper aims to present a data-driven overview of its size and distribution. By doing so, it contributes to a foundational understanding of wage inequality in Switzerland and provides valuable insights that can inform future research and policy development.


\section{Data}

For this analysis, we require official data from the Federal Statistical Office of Switzerland and are divided in four distinct data sets: 

    \begin{itemize}
        \item  Gross monthly wage (central value) by economic division, occupational status and gender \textit{(Monatlicher Bruttolohn (Zentralwert) nach Wirtschaftsabteilungen, beruflicher Stellung und Geschlecht)}
        \item  Gross monthly wage (central value) by occupational group, age and gender\textit{(Monatlicher Bruttolohn (Zentralwert) nach Berufsgruppen, Lebensalter und Geschlecht *)}
        \item  Gross monthly wage (central value) by economic division, occupational status and gender \textit{(Monatlicher Bruttolohn (Zentralwert) nach Wirtschaftsabteilungen, beruflicher Stellung und Geschlecht)}
        \item  Gross monthly wage (central value and quartile range), Swiss and foreign nationals, by occupational status and gender \textit{(Monatlicher Bruttolohn (Zentralwert und Quartilbereich), SchweizerInnen und AusländerInnen, nach beruflicher Stellung und Geschlecht)}
    \end{itemize}


These data sets are provided for the following gross regions:
     \begin{itemize}
        \item Lake Geneva \textit{(Genfersee)}
        \item Midlands\textit{(Mittelland)}
        \item North West\textit{(Nordwestschweiz)}
        \item East \textit{(Ostschweiz)}
        \item Ticino \textit{(Tessin)}
        \item Central \textit{(Zentralschweiz)}
        \item Zurich \textit{(Zürich)}
    \end{itemize}
\\

The gross regions are defined by the Federal Statistical Office. \\
The Lake Geneva region comprises the cantons of Vaud, Valais and Geneva. Midlands comprises the cantons of Bern, Fribourg, Solothurn, Neuchatel and Jura. The cantons of Baselland, Baselstadt and Aargau are in the greater region of Northwestern Switzerland and Eastern Switzerland comprises the cantons of Glarus, Schaffhausen, Appenzell Innerrhoden and Appenzell Ausserrhoden, St. Gallen, Graubünden and Thurgau. Central Switzerland comprises the cantons of Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz, Obwalden and Nidwalden and Zug. The cantons of Zurich and Ticino are each large regions in their own right.


\section{Methodology}

To analyze the gender pay gap in Switzerland, we began by applying data visualization techniques. These included \textbf{bar charts, box plots, and scatter plots}, which provided an initial overview of the distribution and trends in wages across genders. Through these visualizations, we identified key patterns, such as variations in pay across industries, age groups, and education levels. The visualizations served as a critical foundation for understanding the data.\\

The gender pay gap is defined as the absolute difference between the wage of men and women, while the gender pay gap in percent is defined as the relative difference between the wages of men and women.\\
\\
  1. Equation 1: \(\textit{Gender Pay Gap} = \textit{Wage Men} - \textit{Wage Women)}\)\\
  2. Equation 2: \(\textit{Gender Pay Gap in Percent} = 1 - \frac{\textit{Wage Men}} 
 {\textit{Wage Women}}\)\\
\\
The descriptive statistics of the gender pay gap in Switzerland reveal a persistent disparity in earnings between men and women across all industries and time periods examined. On average, women earn significantly less than men. \\

\begin{figure}[h]

    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{../../figures/Salaries_by_Job_Role.png}
    \caption{Gender Pay Gap by Job Role}
    \label{fig:rates_time}
\end{figure}

Significant disparities emerge across occupational categories when analyzing the relative gender pay gap by job roles in Switzerland. The largest gap is observed among \textit{Craftsmen and Skilled Workers}, where women earn, on average, 34.59\% less than men, highlighting a pronounced inequality in traditionally male-dominated roles. Similarly, high gaps are evident in \textit{Academic/Scientific Professions} (22.49\%) and \textit{Executives and Senior Managers} (22.37\%), suggesting that even in highly educated or leadership positions, gender-based pay inequities persist. It is important to note that these statistics do not control for differences in full-time versus part-time employment, which could partially explain the higher observed pay gaps in certain roles, particularly those where part-time work is more common among women.\\


\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{../../figures/Pay_Gap_Trends_by_Job_Role.png}
    \caption{Relative Gender Pay Gap by Job Role}
    \label{fig:rates_time}
\end{figure}

The relative gender pay gap by job role offers a clear depiction of the percentage disparities across various occupational categories, alongside the variations within each category. Even though the gender pay gap of \textit{craftsmen and skilled workers} is the largest (34.59\%), it has the smallest variation across all categories.\\


The high relative gender pay gap among \textit{Craftsmen and Skilled Workers} can be attributed to several structural and societal factors. First, this group aggregaes very diverse specific job roles across various industries. These roles are often male-dominated and associated with traditional gender norms. Additionally, skilled worker roles often involve pay structures influenced by seniority and overtime. The lack of control over full-time versus part-time employment in this analysis further compounds this issue, as women in these roles are more likely to work part-time, reducing their average earnings relative to men. Finally, cultural biases and systemic discrimination in traditionally male-oriented trades may also contribute to the significant disparities observed in this category.\\

The relatively smaller gender pay gap among \textit{Administrative Staff} can likely be attributed to several factors. First, administrative roles often have more standardized pay structures, such as set salary scales or fixed hourly wages, which leave less room for negotiation or discretionary pay that could introduce gender-based disparities. Furthermore, these roles may exhibit less occupational segregation compared to other categories, as they tend to attract a more balanced gender distribution and involve tasks that are not strongly associated with traditional gender norms.Additionally, administrative positions may have fewer hierarchical levels, reducing the opportunities for unequal advancement or promotions that contribute to larger gaps in other sectors, such as executive or academic roles. \\


\begin{figure}[h]

    \caption{Trends in Gross Pay by Gender over Years}
    \label{fig:rates_time}
\end{figure}

The visualization of gross pay across all industries in Switzerland over time reveals an upward trend in wages for both men and women. However, the persistent gap between the two lines underscores the enduring gender pay gap, with men consistently earning higher wages than women. Despite this disparity, the decreasing distance between the lines over time demonstrates a gradual narrowing of the pay gap, suggesting progress toward greater gender wage equality.\\


\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{../../figures/Severity_of_Pay_Gap_by_Role_and_Work_Type.png}
    \caption{Relative Gender Pay Gap by Job Role and Work Tipe}
    \label{fig:rates_time}
\end{figure}

The heat map visualization segregates the data into full-time and part-time workers as well as the defined job roles. It provides key insights into how employment type influences the gender pay gap across professions. \\
In \textit{Academic/Scientific Professions}, the relatively small pay gap difference between full-time and part-time positions suggests that wage structures in this category are less influenced by working hours or employment type. Academic roles often have standardized salary scales tied to qualifications and seniority, rather than hourly or performance-based metrics, which may mitigate disparities between full-time and part-time workers. Moreover, part-time positions in academia may still require high qualifications and specialized expertise, ensuring comparable pay rates. \\

In contrast, the gender pay gap is starkly pronounced in \textit{Craftsmen and Skilled Workers}, where it reaches 28.1\% for full-time roles and escalates to 41.1\% for part-time positions. This significant difference can be attributed to structural and cultural factors within this industry. Part-time roles in skilled professions may often be lower-skilled or less senior positions, which women are more likely to occupy, resulting in wider pay disparities. Additionally, part-time workers in this field may have limited access to bonuses or specialized training opportunities, further exacerbating the gap. The male-dominated nature of these professions also likely contributes to systemic inequalities in wages, promotions, and the valuation of work performed by women, particularly in less visible or part-time roles.\\

In Figure \textbf{XXX}, the distributions of gross wages per job role are further differentiated by gender. A wider box indicates greater variability within a job role category on a gender while the length of the whiskers, which extend from the box to the minimum and maximum values provide information about wage dispersion. Longer whiskers indicate greater variability in pay at the extremes within a group. Longer whiskers may indicate a higher impact of seniority on the wages or higher bargaining power in a job role. \\

In category \textit{Executives, senior managers}, the variability between men and women is the largest. The width of the boxes indicates a wider range of salaries within male, compared to female, suggesting that men are more likely to occupy higher-paying senior positions and more variable roles within executive levels. The long whiskers, extending to both higher and lower extremes of the pay scale, further emphasize this variability on male executives.In contrast, the box for women is smaller, indicatig less variability in pay among female executives and senior managers. However, the whiskers for women are longer than those for men, which suggests a broader spread of salaries at the extremes within the female group. \\
Despite the lengther wisker for women, the absolute value of the whisker remains smaller than the one for men, indicating that fewer women occupy the highest-paying positions within this category. This disparity in the upper pay distribution highlights the underrepresentation of women in the highest-paying senior roles, reinforcing the notion of a "glass ceiling" effect. 




\subsection{Gender Pay Gap Across Gross Regions in Switzerland}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{../../figures/Pay_Gap_Over_Time_Region.png}
    \caption{Gross Gender Pay Gap over Time Across Gross Regions in Switzerland}
    \label{fig:rates_time}
\end{figure}

The observed downward trend in the gender pay gap across Switzerland's gross regions over time suggests a gradual reduction in wage disparities between men and women. This overall decline could be attributed to several factors, including increasing awareness of gender equality and growing social pressures for more equitable pay practices. The trend also likely reflects broader shifts in societal attitudes towards gender roles, with more women entering higher-paying industries and occupations.\\
The largest decline in the gender pay gap is found in the North West region and may be linked to several regional factors. This area includes the city of Basel, its agglomerations and the canton of Aargau, which all are home to a high concentration of multinational corporations in the pharmaceutical, finance and technology sectors. These employers may have increasingly adopted progressive policies around gender pay equity. Furthermore, this region may have seen a greater number of women entering high-paying sectors and leadership roles, contributing to the narrowing of the pay gap..\\
We observe a high variability on the pay gap in the Lake Geneva region. This region is characterized by a high level of economic activity with a diverse mix of industries, from multinational organizations, to global non-profit organizations, hospitality and agriculture. As this analysis is over all industries within the region, the variability is greater compared to regions with concentrated industries within it. \\

    \label{fig:rates_time}
\end{figure}

Figure 6 displays the gross gender pay gap across Switzerlnd's regions and reveals a striking similarity in the magnitude of the disparities, showing only minor differences in absolute wage differences. This suggests that, while the magnitude of the gender pay gap may differ slightly between regions, the overall disparities are relatively consistent nationwide.
